  <Func Arg="rho" Name="CentralizerBlocksOfRepresentation" />
 <Returns>List of vector space generators for the centralizer ring  of <Math>\rho(G)</Math>, written in the basis given by <Ref
  Func="BlockDiagonalBasisOfRepresentation" />.  The matrices are
  given as a list of blocks.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Let <Math>G</Math> have irreducible representations <Math>\rho_i</Math> with
 multiplicities <Math>m_i</Math>. The centralizer has dimension <Math>\sum_i m_i^2</Math>
 as a <Math>\mathbb{C}</Math>-vector space. This function gives the minimal
 number of generators required.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="arg" Name="CentralizerOfRepresentation" />
 <Returns>List of vector space generators for the centralizer ring  of <Math>\rho(G)</Math>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
This gives the same result as <Ref
 Func="CentralizerBlocksOfRepresentation" />, but with the matrices
 given in their entirety: not as lists of blocks, but as full
 matrices.

<Heading>Using the centralizer for computations</Heading>

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="rho, class, cent_basis" Name="ClassSumCentralizer" />
 <Returns><Math>\sum_{s \in t^G} \rho(s)</Math>, where <Math>t</Math> is a representative  of the conjugacy class <A>class</A> of <Math>G</Math>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
We require that <A>rho</A> is unitary. Uses the given
 orthonormal basis (with respect to the inner product <Math>\langle A, B
 \rangle = \mbox{Trace}(AB^*)</Math>) for the centralizer ring of
 <A>rho</A> to calculate the sum of the conjugacy class <A>class</A>
 quickly, i.e. without summing over the class.
 NOTE: Orthonormality of <A>cent_basis</A> and unitarity of
 <A>rho</A> are checked. See <Ref Func="ClassSumCentralizerNC" />
 for a version of this function without checks. The checks are not
 very expensive, so it is recommended you use the function with
 checks.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="rho, class, cent_basis" Name="ClassSumCentralizerNC" />
 <Description>
The same as <Ref Func="ClassSumCentralizer" />, but
 does not check the basis for orthonormality or the representation
 for unitarity.
