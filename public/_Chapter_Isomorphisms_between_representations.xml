  <Func Arg="rho, tau[, rho_cent_basis, tau_cent_basis]" Name="LinearRepresentationIsomorphism" />
 <Returns>A matrix <Math>A</Math> or fail
</Returns>
 <Description>
Let <Math>\rho : G \to GL(V)</Math> and <Math>\tau : G \to GL(W)</Math>. If
there exists a linear map <Math>A : V \to W</Math> such that for all <Math>g \in
G</Math>, <Math>\tau(g)A = A\rho(g)</Math>, this function returns one such <Math>A</Math>. <Math>A</Math>
is the isomorphism between the representations. If the
representations are not isomorphic, then fail is returned.
<P/>
There are three methods that we can use to compute an isomorphism
of linear representations, you can select one by passing options to
the function.

<List>
<Item>
<Code>use_kronecker</Code>: Assumes the matrices are small enough that their
Kronecker products can fit into memory. Uses <Ref
Func="GroupSumBSGS" /> and <Code>KroneckerProduct</Code> to compute an
element of the fixed subspace of <Math>\rho \otimes \tau^*</Math>.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
<Code>use_orbit_sum</Code>: Finds an isomorphism by summing orbits of the
the action of <Math>\rho \otimes \tau^*</Math> on matrices. Note that orbits
could be very large, so this could be as bad as summing over the
whole group.

<P/>
<List>
<Item>
The default, sums over the whole group to compute the projection
onto the fixed subspace.

  <Func Arg="rho, tau" Name="LinearRepresentationIsomorphismSlow" />
 <Returns>A matrix <Math>A</Math> or fail
</Returns>
 <Description>
Gives the same result as <Ref
Func="LinearRepresentationIsomorphism" />, but this function uses a
simpler method which always involves summing over <Math>G</Math>, without
using <Ref Func="GroupSumBSGS" />. This might be useful in some
cases if computing a good BSGS is difficult. However, for all cases
that have been tested, it is slow (as the name suggests).

<Heading>Testing isomorphisms</Heading>

Since representations of finite groups over <Math>\mathbb{C}</Math> are
determined by their characters, it is easy to check whether two
representations are isomorphic by checking if they have the same
character. We try to use characters wherever possible.
<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="rho, tau" Name="AreRepsIsomorphic" />
 <Returns>true if <A>rho</A> and <A>tau</A> are isomorphic as representations, false otherwise.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="A, rho, tau" Name="IsLinearRepresentationIsomorphism" />
 <Returns>true if <A>rho</A> and <A>tau</A> are isomorphic as as representations with the isomorphism given by the linear map <A>A</A>
</Returns>
 <Description>
This function tests if, for all <Math>g \in G</Math>, <Math>A \rho(g)
= \tau(g) A</Math>. That is, true is returned iff <Math>A</Math> is the intertwining
operator taking <Math>\rho</Math> to <Math>\tau</Math>. Note that it is always the case
that:

as long as an isomorphism between the given representations
actually exists.
