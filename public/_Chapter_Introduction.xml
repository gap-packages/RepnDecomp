 This package allows computations of various decompositions of a
 representation <Math>\rho : G \to GL(V)</Math> where <Math>G</Math> is finite and <Math>V</Math> is
 a finite-dimensional <Math>\mathbb{C}</Math>-vector space.

<Heading>Note on what is meant by a representation</Heading>

 Throughout this documentation, mathematical terminology is used
 e.g. representation. It is clear what is meant mathematically, but
 it is not entirely clear what is meant in terms of GAP types - what
 are you supposed to pass in when I say "pass in a representation".
 Occasionally I will not even mention what we are passing in and
 assume the reader knows that <A>rho</A> or <Math>\rho</Math> refers to a
 representation.
 A representation we can use is, in GAP, a homomorphism from a
 finite group to a matrix group where all matrices have coefficients
 in a cyclotomic field (<Code>Cyclotomics</Code> is the union of all such
 fields in GAP). You can check whether something you want to pass is
 suitable with the function <Ref
 Attr="IsFiniteGroupLinearRepresentation" Label="for IsGroupHomomorphism"/>.
<P/>
 Here's an example of a representation <A>rho</A> in GAP:
<P/>
 <Example>
 gap> G := SymmetricGroup(3);
 Sym( [ 1 .. 3 ] )
 gap> images := List(GeneratorsOfGroup(G), g -> PermutationMat(g, 3));
 [ [ [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0, 0 ] ],
   [ [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ] ] ]
 gap> rho := GroupHomomorphismByImages(G, Group(images));
 [ (1,2,3), (1,2) ] -> [ [ [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0, 0 ] ],
   [ [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ] ] ]

<P/>
 The algorithms implemented can be divided into two groups: methods
 due to Serre from his book Linear Representations of Finite Groups,
 and original methods due to the authors of this package.
<P/>
 The default is to use the algorithms due to Serre. If you pass the
 option <Code>method := "alternate"</Code> to a function, it will use the
 alternate method. Passing the option <Code>parallel</Code> will try to compute
 in parallel as much as possible. See the individual functions for
 options you can pass.
<P/>
